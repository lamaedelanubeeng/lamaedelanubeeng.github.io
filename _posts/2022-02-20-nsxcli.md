<h1> NSX-T Central CLI </h1>

I like the NSX-T CLI quite a lot. I think it's very intuitive and covers any (or almost any) use case I've been presented with. The documentation seems really good, we can find it <a href="[url](https://vdc-download.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/cc42e3c1-eb34-4567-a916-147e79798957/8264605c-a5e1-49a8-b603-cc78621eeeab/cli.html.)">here</a> 


Suppose we are facing a scenario where we have to execute one or more actions at the same time on different NSX-T objects. We're going to use the NSX-T CLI. But, Who wants to log manually into all the managers and edges?

Well, luckily there is a way to execute different commands from one of the managers servers, and get them run in all our infrastructure. It is the NSX-T Central CLI, better known as the ON command

How to use. Well, we simply enter one of the managers servers as admin, and type on and tab, the list of available UUIDs will appear. Personally, what I do is copy that list and pass it to excel or a word processor, depending on how many there are, and there "format" the command I want to execute, for each instance.

The easiest example I can think of. I have to configure VRLI as the receiver of the logs for all managers and edges in the environment. We know that the command is as follows:

So, for my case it would be something like this:

And so on for all nodes involved.

With this, we can copy and paste the entire block and wait for each of the commands to be executed. And that's it.

<h1> NSX-T Central CLI </h1>

I like the NSX-T CLI quite a lot. I think it's very intuitive and covers any (or almost any) use case I've been presented with. The documentation seems really good, we can find it <a href="https://vdc-download.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/cc42e3c1-eb34-4567-a916-147e79798957/8264605c-a5e1-49a8-b603-cc78621eeeab/cli.html.">here</a> 


Suppose we are facing a scenario where we have to execute one or more actions at the same time on different NSX-T objects. We're going to use the NSX-T CLI. But, Who wants to log manually into all the managers and edges?

Well, luckily there is a way to execute different commands from one of the managers servers, and get them run in all our infrastructure. It is the NSX-T Central CLI, better known as the ON command

<b>How to use it? </b>

Well, we simply enter one of the managers servers as admin, and type on and tab, the list of available UUIDs will appear.
Personally, what I do is to copy that list and pass it to excel, and there "format" the command I want to execute, for each instance.


Let's see an use case:


I have to configure VRLI as the receiver of the logs for all managers and edges in the environment. We know that the command is as follows:

So, for my case it would be something like this:

And so on,  for all nodes in out NSX-T infrastructure.


With this, we can copy and paste the entire block and wait for each of the commands to be executed. 

Aaaaaand... done!
